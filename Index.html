            <h2>Triple-Threat Artist</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to my professional portfolio. I'm Zachary Neiman-Macak, a 
              dynamic performer who is currently a junior Musical Theatre Major at
              Pace University. My passion lies in creating art in my movements
              while focusing on being versatile for numerous leading, supporting and 
              ensemble roles.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a strong foundation of ten years in gymnastics, I have also been 
              a part of several rock bands, and can be seen in several commercials 
              as well as background work in television shows. Some of my recent credits
              include Charlie Price in Kinky Boots, Tony in West Side Story, and Finch in 
              Newsies with 5-star Theatreicals. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from performing, I am a certified Pokemon and Nintendo enthusiast,
              a firm ally of the Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme, and a man who loves creating
              original music and rock climbing.  <a href=""></a>
